# Tom C. Gorordo
[I'm an alum who graduated in 2019](https://tom.ket.dev). I was bookie, blouse frosh, and generally did a lot of odd-jobs & stuff. 
I was on the Bechtel COUCH committee to figure out what life would look like there - so I'm pretty experienced dealing with admin BS.
I've talked my way out of a fair amount of trouble with the taco trucks and knew *a lot* about running tours as red or gold.

Crusty af now as you can read - jeez time flies - but a massive sucker if you ever want a hand with your Ditch Day stack or *anything* else.

Here are the things I have on [titanic](https://titanic.caltech.edu):

## DiscordBot-LightsOut

I wrote a discord bot & cli tool to play and solve [lightsout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) games for
Ditch Day 2020 as alum help. It was written in a day, so it's pretty hacky but it can manage arbitrary NxN prime-number-colored boards.
The bot runs from my account on titanic whenever I remember to have it running/restart it and can be played on the γδβall-discord bot interaction channel.

Here's an installation link:
